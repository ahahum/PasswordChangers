The Thycotic Extensible Discovery Script Repository is a repository of scripts that have been created by internal Thycotic consultants, support representatives, and others, along with clients, and partners of Thycotic. As such:

The scripts have to be changed to match your environment.
The scripts have NOT been tested for quality assurance in any way and are offered as is with no warranty.
The scripts are not covered by Thycotic's regular support policy, or any other implied policy.
By downloading a script from this repository, you acknowledge that you are using this as a starting point, and doing so at your own risk.
Should you need help implementing these scripts in your environment in a formally 'Quality Assured' fashion, please reach out to your Client Services representative to discuss a Professional Services engagement in order to do that.
